# Disclaimer
This Webapp only works on [Android]!

It will not work on iOS, or a Desktop computer without some hacking around.

This uses slightly different algorithms than SoundHoundPython, because the resources and library files are different.. 
but the math behind the wave that generates the image is the same..

Nonetheless, output from this webapp can be verified using the Python image decoder.
